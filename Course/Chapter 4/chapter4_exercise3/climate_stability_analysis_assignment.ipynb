    "### Comparing Weather Temperature Variability for Agricultural Investment Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**context:** An agricultural investment firm is in the process of deciding on a location for a new farming project. Understanding that **consistent** and predictable weather conditions are vital for successful agriculture, the firm aims to evaluate and compare two potential cities based on their temperature stability. The key factor in this decision-making process is the variability in average daily temperatures, as it directly impacts crop growth and agricultural planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The firm has provided a dataset, named **\"climate_stability_comparison.xlsx\"**, to aid in this assessment. This dataset includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **month:** Indicates the month of the year.\n",
    "- **Avg Temp City A (°C):** The average daily temperature for City A in each month, measured in degrees Celsius.\n",
    "- **Avg Temp City B (°C):** The average daily temperature for City B in each month, measured in degrees Celsius."
